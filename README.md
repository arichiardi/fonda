# Fonda

An async pipeline approach to functional core - imperative shell from by Gary Bernhardt's [Boundaries talk.](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)

## Minimal Viable Example

This example illustrates `fonda`'s basic mechanics:

```clojure
(ns fonda.example.simple
  (:require [cljs-http.client :as http]
            [cljs.core.async :as cca :include-macros true]
            [clojure.set :as set]
            [fonda.core :as fonda]))

(fonda/execute
 {:initial-ctx     {:username js/process.USER
                    :password js/process.PASSWORD}}

 [{:processor      (fn [ctx]
                     (http/get "http://insecure-endpoint.com"
                               {:basic-auth (select-keys ctx [:username :password])}))
   :name           "get-all-things"
   :path           [:github-response]}

  {:processor      github-response->things   ;; Pure function - ctx in -> ctx out
   :name           "github-response->things"
   :path           [:github-things]}]

 ;; on-success
 (fn [ctx]
   (handle-success (:github-things ctx)))

 ;; on-exception
 (fn [exception]
   (handle-exception exception)))
```
*HINT*: The parameter order makes it easy to partially apply `execute` for leaner call sites.

---

Fonda sequentially executes a series of [steps](#trivia), one after the other, augmenting a context map. The steps can be synchronous or asyncronous. After the steps are run, the termination callbacks will be executed.

If a `js/Error`, an exception in `fonda` parlance, is thrown it will be automatically caught and the chain short circuits and the `on-exception` function is called with the `js/Error`.

Exceptions are things we can't and don't want to recover from, like unexpected bugs.

## Anomalies

Anomaly is

  > Deviation or departure from the normal or common order, form, or rule.

There is a stark contrast between anomalies and JavaScript `js/Error`s, Promise rejections or Java `Exception`s: anomalies are data that define a recoverable error, like receiving a 409 (conflict) http status code that you can retry.

Anomalies are first class citizens in `fonda` and by default they are maps containing the [`:cognitect.anomalies/anomaly`](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/anomalies) key.

It is also possible to redefine what an anomaly is by passing a config predicate, `anomaly?`, so that client code can have its own representation of an anomaly.

An anomaly returned by a step will also short circuit and afterwards `on-anomaly` function is called.

The following section describes the parameters `fonda/execute` accepts.

## Parameters

- **config** - static configuration map

    | Key | Optional? | Notes |
    |---|---|---|
    | `:anomaly?` | Yes | A function that gets a map and determines if it is an anomaly |
    | `:initial-ctx` | Yes | The data that initializes the context. Must be a map, `{}` by default. |

 A function that gets the context map. If it succeeds, the result is then ignored.
            It will still block the steps processing if it is asynchronous, and it will interrupt the steps execution if it returns an anomaly, or it triggers an exception

- **steps** - each item must be either a `Tap` or a `Processor`

  - tap

    | Key | Optional? | Notes |
    |---|---|---|
    | `:tap` | No | A function that gets the context but doesn't augment it. If it succeeds the result is ignored. If asynchronous it will still block the pipeline and interrupt the execution whenever either an anomaly or an exception happen. |
    | `:name` | No | The name of the step |

  - processor

    | Key | Optional? | Notes |
    |---|---|---|
    | `:processor` | No | A function that gets the context and returns data. The data is [assoced-in](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/assoc-in) at the given path Can be asynchronous. If asynchronous it will still block the pipeline and interrupt the execution whenever either an anomaly or an exception happen. |
    | `:path` | No | Path where to assoc the result of the processor |
    | `:name` | No | The name of the step |


- **on-success**   Callback that gets called with the context if all steps succeed.
- **on-anomaly**   Callback that gets called with an anomaly when any of the steps returns one.
- **on-exception** Callback that gets called with an exception when any of the steps throws one.

## Full Example

```clojure
(fonda/execute
  {:initial-ctx     {:env-var-xyz "value"}

  [{:processor      (fn [ctx]
                      (ajax/GET "http://remote-thing-url.com" {:params (:remote-thing-params ctx)})
    :name           "get-remote-thing"
    :path           [:remote-thing-response]}

   {:tap            (fn [{:keys [remote-thing-response]}]
                      (println "the remote thing response was:" remote-thing-response))}

   {:processor      process-remote-thing-response ;; Pure function - ctx in - ctx out
    :name           "process-thing-response"
    :path           [:remote-thing]}]

  ;; on-success
  (fn [{:keys [remote-thing-processed]}]
   (handle-success remote-thing-processed))

  ;; on-anomaly
  (fn [anomaly]
   (handle-anomaly anomaly))

  ;; on-exception
  (fn [exception]
   (handle-exception exception)))

```

## Trivia

The name got inspired by Jane Fonda's step very successful fitness programs.

As with the fitness program, `fonda` consist of well-curated üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è steps üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
